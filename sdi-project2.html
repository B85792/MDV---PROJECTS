    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>I chose building kitchen cabinets because woodworking has always been a hobby for me, although this particular project was a first time adventure. Also, it was a great learning experience for myself. Where I learned that I had to go about things in a certain order, in order to get the finished result that I wanted.</p>
<p>There are different types of woods that are used for different applications, which are sometimes classified as soft woods and hard woods, which I chose to go with hard oak, since they would be enduring a lot of wear and tear in the kitchen area of the home. Also there many brands and sizes of table saws, I chose a Dewalt saw for the durability that I have always gotten out of the Dewalt products.</p>
